## Hey, this is us 👋

Arkemis is developing Arke BaaS, a next-generation backend-as-a-service that combines the simplicity of low-code platforms with the power and flexibility of open-source technology.
Built in Elixir, Arke BaaS allows developers, startups, and digital teams to create fully functional backends in minutes, directly from a self-service web interface — no installation or configuration required.

Arche means knowledge principle.
Arke is our development principle, a opensource framework.

Users can design data models, manage authentication, define business logic, and generate APIs automatically, all while maintaining full visibility and control over their architecture.
Arke BaaS introduces a modular, plug-and-play ecosystem, where teams can share or reuse community-built modules to accelerate development.

With integrated tools for environment management, Arke BaaS aims to bridge the gap between closed, rigid low-code platforms like Firebase and the complexity of full custom setups — delivering a scalable, open, and developer-centric platform for modern backend development.
 
Are you aware of any Italian teams that are developing similar solutions?
We would love to fight the market giants together. 💪
