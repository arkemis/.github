## Hey, this is us 👋

We are building Arke, the unified low-code framework to shape next-gen application for unleash your creativity and vision. 

![Unleash your creativity and vision](https://github.com/arkemishub/.github/assets/81776297/b1d96acf-d298-4b0a-85d5-bf3f0b8a4064)

What is the best way to optimize my work? Whatever your business, you will have asked yourself this question at least once.

Tools that help with email composition, business management, ChatGPT, Google Bard and unicorns that fly.

To write less, to draw less, to do less.
 
We at Arkemis with collaboration of Mokka Studios have thought about how to code less, to offer developers and clients something more: a technology platform that speeds up development while maintaining high customization of code.

Arche means knowledge principle.
Arke is our development principle, a lowcode opensource framework.
 
Are you aware of any Italian teams that are developing similar solutions?
We would love to fight the market giants together. 💪
