## Hey, this is us 👋

Arkemis is developing Arke BaaS, a next-generation backend-as-a-service that combines the simplicity of low-code platforms with the power and flexibility of open-source technology.
Built in Elixir, Arke BaaS allows developers, startups, and digital teams to create fully functional backends in minutes, directly from a self-service web interface — no installation or configuration required.

Arche means knowledge principle.
Arke is our development principle, a opensource framework.
 
Are you aware of any Italian teams that are developing similar solutions?
We would love to fight the market giants together. 💪
